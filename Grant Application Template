## Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience.  If the project involves development work, then we'd appreciated if you can single out a few interesting code commits made by team members on their past projects.  We'll glance at whole repositories too, but not if they contain many vendored dependencies, which often makes commits easier.

## Development Roadmap
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to have as much detail as possible. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

The aelf DAO Management Committee divides awards into four categories based on the complexity and usefulness of the community:
Small -5K-50K ELF.
Medium-50K-200K ELF.
Large-200K+ ELF.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**.  That teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. It is always best to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product.

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to test that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone. Please reach out to grants@aelf.io to discuss what amount would be appropriate for your project.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please commit to providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Milestone 1 — Implement Substrate Modules — 1 month — 10k ELF
* We will create a module that will... (Please list the functions that will be coded for the first milestone).
* We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user work.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Additional features — 1 month — 10k ELF
* We will create a module that will... (Please list the functions that will be coded for the first milestone).
* We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user work.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 3 — Additional features — 1 month — 10k ELF
